# KNN-algorithm-from-scratch
KNN algorith from scratch in python and jupyter notebook 

This algo is based on euclideanDistance method

We first load the dataset and divide it into training and test data sets

we define functions  for euclideanDistance 

Then we get nearest neighbors on basis of euclideanDistance based on the value of K

Then on basis of the majority class the unknown point is given its class

We then test accuracy on basis of test set with reference to training Set
